As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want

    Listing the notes, should be fine
    Am listing notes atm but it is ugly, try and redo listing with div elements first
    Abbreviated to only 20 characters, don't know how to do this, research

As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember

Create a new note, should be fin
Use text boxes and buttons to collect data, submitting via calling the JS methods

As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page

Note sure how to create a page for each individual note
I recall something similar was part of a previous challenge, perhaps airbnb?

As a programmer
I can use shortcodes like `:fire:` that get converted into emojis like ðŸ”¥
So I can record notes with fun little pictures

Above is a nice to have, return to only if you have ample time
